Student Management System (Console-based Java Application)
📌 Project Overview

This is a console-based Core Java application for managing student records. It uses Roll Numbers as unique identifiers for students and supports basic CRUD operations. The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the use of the Java Collection Framework (HashMap) for efficient data storage and retrieval.

🚀 Features

➕ Add Student – Register a new student with Roll Number and details.

👀 View All Students – Display all student records stored in the system.

🔍 Search Student – Find a student by Roll Number.

✏️ Update Student – Modify existing student details.

❌ Delete Student – Remove a student record using Roll Number.

⚡ How It Works

The system stores student records in a HashMap where:

Key = Roll Number (Unique ID)

Value = Student Object

User interacts via console menu options to perform CRUD operations.

Ensures efficient data retrieval using the HashMap’s constant-time lookup.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Practice with Core Java fundamentals.

Understand CRUD operations in a console-based program.

Explore the Collection Framework and HashMap usage.

Apply OOP principles in real-world applications.
